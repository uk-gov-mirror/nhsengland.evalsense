## Unreleased

### Enhancements
- None

### Bug fixes
- None

### Documentation
- None

## v0.1.5

### Miscellaneous
-  Move web UI dependencies to a separate `webui` extra.

## v0.1.4

### Breaking changes
- The API and the internal logic of dataset managers have been updated. The `priority` argument to the constructor is no longer used. Instead, all classes inheriting from `DatasetManager` should define a class-level `priority` attribute. Additionally, the file-based dataset managers, such as the built-in `AciBenchDatasetManager`, now preprocess all splits when retrieving the dataset. This is more expensive, but prevents issues with loading different splits.
- EvalSense no longer overrides `HF_HUB_CACHE` and `HF_XET_CACHE` according to `EVALSENSE_STORAGE_DIR` and does not expose `MODELS_PATH` as a constant. Instead, the standard HuggingFace directory is used for storing models. If you wish to change this directory, you can do so by setting the appropriate [environment variables](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/package_reference/environment_variables) directly.

### Enhancements
- EvalSense now provides a web-based graphical user interface for experimenting with evaluation workflows. This can be accessed by running `evalsense webui`.
- EvalSense now supports meta-evaluation of different evaluation methods using `MetaResultAnalyser`.
- It is now possible to construct dataset managers using the `DatasetManager.create(...)` class method, which automatically instantiates the dataset manager associated with the passed dataset name. This is facilitated by an internal registry of dataset managers.
- A new `HuggingFaceDatasetManager` enables loading arbitrary datasets from Hugging Face Hub.

### Bug fixes
- Fix `method_filter_fun` behaviour in `MetricCorrelationAnalyser`.

## v0.1.3

### Breaking changes

- Make local model dependencies optional during package installation. If you are using EvalSense with local models, you should install `evalsense[all]` or `evalsense[local]` instead of `evalsense`.

## v0.1.2

Technical release: no user-facing changes.

## v0.1.1

Technical release: no user-facing changes.

## v0.1.0

Initial release.
